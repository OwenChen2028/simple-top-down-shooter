# Simple Top Down Shooter

**Simple Top Down Shooter** was my one of my first game development projects. As a result, the code is a bit messy and contains several bad practices. However, the gameplay and non-UI visuals are relatively polished and I am quite proud of how it turned out. 

The project is available to play at: https://ilikeovensalot.itch.io/simple-top-down-shooter
